# BIO_350_F25
Starting our BIO350 assignments repo.

IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
 -  Making a difference equation
 -  technical difficulties 

IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook
 -  Making an exponential equation to measure how quickly duckweed covers a pond
 -  confusion and technical difficulties
 -  introduced matplotlib and plotting on x y axis
 -  graph was blank at first but somehow managed to get data to show up 

IC Example 1 : log and conditional elements
 - turned graph from assignment 2 into a log 
 - created if, if else, and else conditions 
 - created more graphs changing the algoritm

IC Assignment 3: Chapter 3 of Ecology Handbook
 - logistic growth model
 - understand and define variables before coding ; type out parameters in markdown to ease process
 - make sure to add correct spaces/symbols in code and make sure the names of the variables are consistent throughout

IC Example 2 : importing data and messing with inline copilot chat
 - imported our own data file and saving it in the right place (BIO 350 file)
 - utilized previous code for plots
 - relied on Copilot to generate code based on what I told it to do and how I wanted the plot to look
 - used average function to determine carrying capactiy and further used Copilot to display it on the graph

IC Assignment 4: Chapter 4 of Ecology Handbook
 - logistic growth with two species competing
 - understand and define variables before coding ; type out parameters in markdown to ease process
 - ensure variables are defined consistently throughout the code
 - used copilot to understand the competitive exclusion principle and how it relates to the equations
 - don't overuse copilot, try to understand the code yourself first
