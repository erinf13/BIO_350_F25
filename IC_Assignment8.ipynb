    "A local nature museum would like to install a camera to stream real-time video of an eagle nest in the landscape surrounding the museum. The museum is hoping to install the camera at a nest with at least two eggs in it. A published study on nesting success of this eagle species in a similar habitat reported finding 4 nests with one egg, 14 nests with two eggs, and 2 nests with three eggs. What is the probability that the camera team will find two or more eggs in the first nest that it examines? What is the probability that the team will look at three nests in a row and find only one egg in each? What is the average number of eggs per nest of this eagle species?\n",
