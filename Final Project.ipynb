    "### Final Project - Harnessing analysis techniques for your own work\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "- Introduction, analysis method, paper description\n",
    "    - decide on an analysis method that you're interested in\n",
    "    - find a paper that uses the analysis method and/or has github or other coding explanations or examples\n",
    "    - discuss how you could use that analysis on your own data, example data, or another paper's data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Goals for week of 11/3/2025:\n",
    "    - find a paper that conducts an experiment/analysis that you find interesting and is relatively related to the class\n",
    "    - read and document their raw data, code, analysis, and write up a brief introduction on the analysis and what their data/code/analysis looks like\n",
    "    - if you were to create a model, algorithm, or machine learning method, what would your input data look like? What are you trying to model? What does your output data look like? \n",

    "They assessed the differences in host mortality among treatments by building Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each treatment group using the survival package in R, then compared the results using log-rank tests. Post hoc tests were performed using Tukey's post hoc tests and a series of linear regression models were created to assess differences in body condition. Paired t-tests were used to determine differences in pathogen load and body condition between time points. \n",

    "I have used this package and done some similar coding in a previous class. \n",

    "I would be able to recreate this by creating a sample population and sample data following their variable breakdown. Their raw data is provided so I can compare my fake data to theirs for replication. "
